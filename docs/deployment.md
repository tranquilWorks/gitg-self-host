# Deployment

## Supported single-instance topology

The application runs one `app` service. Gunicorn listens on `0.0.0.0:8000` in the
container, and Docker Compose maps the configured host port. SQLite and future
uploaded application data live under `/data` in a named volume.

There is no reverse proxy, database service, cache, queue, or Node.js runtime.

## First installation

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` before starting:

| Variable | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| `APP_PORT` | Host port; defaults to `3000`. |
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | Long random value unique to this instance. |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated hostnames/LAN IPs used to open the app. |
| `APP_BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME` | First username, used only if no user exists. |
| `APP_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` | First password, used only if no user exists. |
| `APP_TIME_ZONE` | IANA zone such as `America/Los_Angeles`; defaults to `UTC`. |
| `APP_DEBUG` | Keep `false` in deployment. |
| `APP_SECURE_COOKIES` | Keep `false` for direct HTTP; set `true` behind HTTPS. |
| `APP_OWNER_RETENTION_ENABLED` | Keep `false` unless the owner deliberately enables previewable draft/feedback retention. |
| `APP_OWNER_RETENTION_DAYS` | Explicit window from 30 to 3,650 days; defaults to `365`. |

Generate a secret key:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))"
```

Start:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --no-build
docker compose ps
```

Open:

```text
http://<server-local-ip>:<APP_PORT>
```

For example, with server IP `192.168.1.20` and the default port:
`http://192.168.1.20:3000`. Ensure `192.168.1.20` appears in
`DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

## Published images

The verified main revision is published to
`ghcr.io/tranquilworks/gitg-self-host:latest` for Linux AMD64 and ARM64. Each
publication also has `sha-<full-commit>` and digest references. `APP_IMAGE` in
`.env` can select one of those references for a reproducible upgrade or rollback.
The publishing job runs only after the main revision passes the aggregate
**Pilot readiness gate**; it pulls the resulting digest and validates its catalog.

For a source build, run `docker compose up -d --build`. For a published image,
use `docker compose pull` followed by `docker compose up -d --no-build` so a
local build does not replace the pulled image.

GitHub initially creates container packages as private. If anonymous pulls are
not enabled for this package, authenticate to `ghcr.io` with your GitHub account
and a classic personal access token with `read:packages`, using Docker’s
`--password-stdin` option. An organization/package administrator can enable public
visibility in the [package settings](https://github.com/orgs/tranquilWorks/packages/container/package/gitg-self-host/settings).
See [GitHub’s registry documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

## Startup contract

The non-root container user runs these steps on every start:

1. `manage.py validate_canonical_content`
2. `manage.py migrate --noinput`
3. `manage.py bootstrap_user`
4. `manage.py seed_canonical`
5. `manage.py backfill_evidence_events`
6. `manage.py rebuild_score_state`
7. `manage.py rebuild_composite_score_state`
8. `manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
9. `gunicorn grounded_growth.wsgi:application`

Migrations, seeding, evidence backfill, and both score-state reconciliations
are idempotent. Historical state processes only explicitly legacy-version
events. Composite state processes only immutable human-closeout credit events,
verifies replay, and appends a rebuild snapshot only when current state or its
audit metadata actually drifted. Bootstrap creation occurs only when the auth
user table is empty. An existing user prevents password creation or reset,
even if bootstrap environment values change.

## Authentication hardening

After confirming the first login:

1. Open **Account** and change the password, or run:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec app python manage.py changepassword <username>
   ```

2. Remove `APP_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` from `.env`.
3. Restart:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Django stores only its salted password hash in SQLite. Sessions use HttpOnly,
SameSite=Lax cookies. CSRF middleware protects state-changing requests.

## Health, logs, and shutdown

The unauthenticated health endpoint is:

```bash
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:${APP_PORT:-3000}/health/
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status": "ok"}
```

Inspect stdout/stderr logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f app
```

Gunicorn receives the container stop signal because the entrypoint uses
`exec`. Compose allows a 30-second graceful-stop window.

```bash
docker compose down
```

`down` removes the container and network but preserves the named volume. Do
not add `--volumes` unless permanent data deletion is intended.

## Persistence

Compose mounts:

```text
grounded_growth_data:/data
```

The database is:

```text
/data/grounded_growth.sqlite3
```

Future uploads use `/data/uploads`; backups use `/data/backups`.

Assessment runs, share codes, practice setup records, draft/submitted
check-ins, immutable evidence events, exact assessment baseline mass, and final
reviews all live in the same SQLite database and survive container replacement
with the named volume. M3B current lever state and immutable hashed score
snapshots live in that same database; assessment baselines remain separate.
Optional M5A pilot-feedback records also persist in SQLite, but remain in a
separate table and never enter assessment, evidence, score, recommendation, or
completion services. Optional M6C assessment/practice context and Personal OS
revisions are append-only, assessment-epoch-scoped private local data in the
same database and backups. Context priority results are reproducible and are
not stored. Authored Personal OS text is not a ranking, evidence, score,
activation, telemetry, or existing-export input.
M6H weekly plans and proof reviews also persist in SQLite and backups. They
contain stable linkage, schedule, categorical review state, and replayable
proof references, but no Personal OS prose. They do not create evidence or
score state.
M6I assessment-calibration consent revisions also persist in SQLite and
backups. Ordinary assessment storage is never implicit calibration consent;
only the latest explicit per-run choice controls future local exports.

## Updating

Finish or explicitly stop active/paused practices whose instructions change before
upgrading. The importer deliberately rejects replacement of in-progress practice
instructions or evidence rules. It never silently converts an existing attempt.
If an upgrade stops at this guard, restart the previous pinned image and finish
or stop the practice there; keep its data volume and backup.

Record the current image digest before upgrading (`docker inspect` on the running
container shows its image ID). Keep that image locally or pin its published digest
for rollback. Use the verified pre-upgrade workflow:

```bash
docker compose exec app python manage.py backup_database \
  --output /data/backups/pre-upgrade.sqlite3
docker compose exec app python manage.py verify_database_backup \
  /data/backups/pre-upgrade.sqlite3 --compare-live
git pull --ff-only
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --no-build
docker compose ps
docker compose exec app python manage.py migrate --check
docker compose exec app python manage.py verify_m6h_operations_readiness
docker compose exec app python manage.py verify_assessment_calibration_collection
```

Startup applies new migrations and reconciles canonical seed data by stable
ID. Review `docs/data-import.md` before changing canonical files.

After an update, sign in and verify:

1. `/assessment/` loads the locally served scorer;
2. `/practices/` shows the friendship protocol;
3. any current practice and draft check-ins remain present;
4. a submitted check-in opens its evidence-reading page;
5. `/evidence/` shows only the signed-in user's submitted events;
6. `make evidence-verify` reports complete replay coverage;
7. `make score-verify` reports deterministic score-state coverage;
8. `make composite-score-verify` reports deterministic assessment-composite
   and human-closeout replay coverage;
9. `/profile/` distinguishes assessment-derived starting estimates from
   completion credit, coverage, and remaining priority;
10. `/health/` returns `{"status":"ok"}`.
11. `docker compose exec app python manage.py verify_pilot_readiness` reports
    the exact 383-protocol runtime boundary and replay state.
12. **Account → Open feedback form** explains that pilot feedback is optional,
    local, and separate from developmental state.
13. `/personal-os/` and
    `/personal-os/practices/<slug>/context/` require authentication, use the
    signed-in user's latest assessment, show no carried-forward values after
    reassessment, and state the local-backup and
    no-dedicated-export/purge/retention boundaries before collection.
14. `docker compose exec app python manage.py
    verify_m6c_pilot_readiness` reports all six prerequisite readiness
    contracts, the exact 383-protocol projection, registered authenticated
    browser routes, and all-catalog activation without writing data.
15. `/weekly/` shows one current-practice action and an explicit proof state;
    `docker compose exec app python manage.py
    verify_weekly_execution_readiness` replays plans and reviews without
    writing data or printing private values.
16. **Account → Data management** labels calibration contribution as optional
    sensitive pseudonymous data, excludes the demonstration seed, and permits
    inspecting and withdrawing the signed-in owner's current contribution.

The evidence verifier is intentionally not an automatic repair step. Startup
backfill reconciles missing legacy events and verifies existing ones;
`evidence-verify` is the strict read-only operational audit. See
`docs/evidence-audit.md`.

Score-state operations are:

```bash
docker compose exec app python manage.py rebuild_score_state --verify-only
docker compose exec app python manage.py rebuild_score_state
docker compose exec app python manage.py rebuild_composite_score_state --verify-only
docker compose exec app python manage.py rebuild_composite_score_state
```

The two `--verify-only` commands are read-only. The write variants initialize
pending state and repair drift from immutable legacy evidence or composite
closeout events with audit snapshots. To permanently exclude one processed
historical event from current state without deleting it from the evidence
ledger:

```bash
docker compose exec app python manage.py rebuild_score_state \
  --reverse-event <event-uuid> \
  --reason "Documented correction reason"
```

Reversal is idempotent and has no M3B undo command. Back up first and use it
only for a documented correction. See `docs/scoring-state.md`.

Optional pilot feedback has a separate participant-data lifecycle. Preview
the exact user-scoped deletion first:

```bash
docker compose exec app python manage.py purge_pilot_feedback \
  --username <username>
```

After confirming the count and the participant agreement:

```bash
docker compose exec app python manage.py purge_pilot_feedback \
  --username <username> \
  --confirm
```

This command does not touch developmental state. It also does not remove rows
from existing backups; apply the same retention decision to backup copies.

An operator may write the current explicitly consented calibration dataset to
a new private file only after reviewing its sensitive-data boundary:

```bash
docker compose exec app python manage.py export_assessment_calibration_dataset \
  --output /data/backups/assessment-calibration.json \
  --confirm-sensitive-export
```

The command creates mode `0600`, refuses overwrite, performs no upload, and
fails closed if consent or included assessment data does not replay. Withdrawal
removes a run from future exports but cannot recall a previously downloaded
copy; handle every copy under the agreed private-data lifecycle.

Analyze that exact export only on private local storage:

```bash
docker compose exec app python manage.py analyze_assessment_calibration_dataset \
  --input /data/backups/assessment-calibration.json \
  --output /data/backups/assessment-calibration-analysis.json \
  --confirm-sensitive-input
```

The analyzer verifies the export contract and hash, reads no live database,
performs no upload, refuses overwrite, and creates mode `0600`. Its aggregate
suppresses nonzero cells below five and omits participant rows, pseudonyms, raw
responses, raw timing, and identity-bearing fields. It is still sensitive and
not safe for public sharing. Its 30-participant workflow thresholds and
exploratory retest agreement do not establish reliability, validity, fairness,
burden, fit, outcomes, or any other participant evidence axis.

## HTTPS or remote access later

M1 intentionally has no reverse proxy. For remote access, first establish an
appropriate threat model, place Caddy or another maintained proxy in front of
the app, use HTTPS, restrict network exposure, and set:

```text
APP_SECURE_COOKIES=true
```

Do not expose the direct HTTP port to the public internet.

## Repeatable deployment verification

Run the complete deployment drill from a Docker-capable host:

```bash
make compose-smoke
```

The drill builds the production image and uses an isolated Compose project,
temporary environment files, a free host port, and a throwaway named volume.
It verifies:

- the Compose health check and public `/health/` response;
- anonymous redirect plus a real CSRF-protected login over the mapped port;
- the non-root runtime, applied migrations, exact canonical counts, repeated
  seed idempotency, evidence replay, legacy and composite score-state replay,
  the exact 383-practice/1,151-action scoring disposition, and the read-only
  `GG-PILOT-READINESS-1.0` and additive
  `GG-M6C-PILOT-READINESS-1.0` contracts;
- conspicuously synthetic Personal OS and context revisions created through
  public services, a deterministic context-priority result, and authenticated
  HTTP access to the Personal OS surface;
- database and bootstrap-password persistence after forced container
  recreation, including synthetic revision/result hashes and unchanged
  the 383-protocol activation boundary;
- an online SQLite backup, `PRAGMA integrity_check`, and restore that preserve
  those synthetic hashes and the activation boundary;
- clean Gunicorn shutdown.

The script removes its isolated containers and volume on exit. It does not
read or modify the deployment `.env` or `grounded_growth_data` volume.
`APP_ENV_FILE` is an internal Compose override used by this drill; normal
deployment continues to default to `.env`.

GitHub Actions runs the same command in
`.github/workflows/verification.yml`, alongside Ruff, Django, pytest,
the isolated `make pilot-check`, and Playwright. The aggregate **Pilot
readiness gate** succeeds only when quality, browser, and Compose all pass.

The drill is isolated deployment-drill evidence. It does not release or deploy
the application, approve a participant pilot, or establish recommendation
usefulness, specialist review, accessibility-population, cultural-safety,
clinical, psychometric, longitudinal, or production validity.

## Private-pilot feedback data

M5A adds no analytics host or outbound feedback integration. Participant
feedback stays in `/data/grounded_growth.sqlite3` and is covered by the normal
backup/restore procedure. The authenticated minimized download is available at
`/account/pilot-feedback/export.json`.

The download excludes free text and direct identifiers, but remains sensitive
pilot data. Review it before sharing, avoid participant names in filenames,
and retain it only where access is appropriate. Local free-text comments stay
inside the database and backup; they are never included in the minimized
export.
